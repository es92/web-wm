switch tabs to workspace style numbers

configurable colors / active indicator size / tab sizes

workspace support

shared cross tab state? Is this possible?

higher level active wm nodes
  - move groups of nodes at a time
  - close groups of nodes at a time

- change movement behavior
  - regroup nodes, ex:
        _ _
        ___
  - move top right right means:
        _ |
        _ |
  - basically
    if there isn't a node to switch with, make new parent so can make that element the dir-most element in the parent-group
normal floating layout / manager
